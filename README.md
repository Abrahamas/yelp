# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page. (+2pt)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

 - [X] You can see the keyboard when you tap in the search bar and hide when you tap outside the search bar

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
